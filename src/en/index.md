Hello my name is Tanya. I'm a front-end developer who loves making stuff for the web, digital accessibility, and telling others about it. In addition, I organized [Petersburg pitera11y_meetup]({{ links.public.pitera11y }}), write and translate articles, and also edit in [Doka]({{ links.public.doka }}) - a reference for developers.

In this blog I share tips, useful links, my thoughts and simply interesting finds about affordable development âœ¨

If you have any questions about the blog or accessibility, you can ask me on [Twitter]({{ links.social.twitter }}).
