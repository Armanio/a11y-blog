Hi, my name is Tatiana Fokina. I'm a front-end developer who likes to make stuff for the web, and digital accessibility and tell others about it. 

I write and translate articles and also edit at [Doka]({{ links.public.doka }}) - a developer friendly directory. I organised [St. Petersburg pitera11y_meetup]({{ links.public.pitera11y }}), 

In this blog, I share practical tips, useful links, my thoughts and just interesting findings about accessible development âœ¨

If there are any questions about my articles or accessibility, you are welcome to ask me on [Twitter]({{ links.social.twitter }}).
