Hi, my name is Tatiana Fokina, or just Tanya for short. Who am I? I am a web accessibility specialist and enthusiast who likes developing user-friendly interfaces and discussing digital accessibility with others (sometimes in the middle of the night).

I write and translate articles, and I am also an editor of the “Accessibility” section in [Doka Guide]({{links.public.doka}}), a Russian language community-driven documentation. Now, I have a new role — one of the hosts of the first Russian-speaking podcast about accessibility and inclusion, [Inclusive Pineapple]({{links.social.pineapple}}) (because why not?). A long time ago, I even organized [St. Petersburg pitera11y_meetup]({{links.public.pitera11y}}).

In this blog, I share practical tips and hacks, useful links, my thoughts, and interesting findings about accessible code, design, and much more ✨

If you have any questions about my articles or accessibility, feel free to ask me on [LinkedIn]({{links.social.linkedin}}) and [Twitter]({{links.social.twitter}}).
